# ToMatlab
The functions in this package provide an automated way of generating Matlab m-files from Mathematica expressions. This is based on the package by Harri Ojanen available at http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/577/ and has been updated to include support for the following functions:
 * imag()
 * real()
 * conj()
